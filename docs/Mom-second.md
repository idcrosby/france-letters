Hello again,

TREAT of TREATS !!! I should complain to you people more often. I FOUND A LIBRARY!!! I
decided one day to go through the phone book for Montpellier and call the main branch to see if they
carried any English novels. I found a listing for the “Bibliothèque Américaine”. And it really is, All
the material is in English - novels, reference books, periodicals, you name it. Needless to Say,
Kenneth and I ran right down and became card-carrying members. A few days after that I found
baking soda in a store, and a few days after that I found a box of rolled oats, Now maybe I should
complain about their icing sugar.

We received a tape from Jeanie of the Rankins' latest album (thank you, Jeanie) and on it is
a song I used to hear on my grandfather's knee (or so they told me) called “Ho Ro Mo Nighean Donn
Bhoidheach”. But I think the Rankins need to polish up their Gaelic because we always called it “A
Roamin’ in Yon Voya". For those of you who can't recall the tune, Dorita can give you a rousing
chorus.

Christmas was quiet but pleasant and we took pictures of our lovely little two-foot tree so
you can all see it when we get home. That's in only four months and we've already been here four
and a bit. Hard to believe isn't it?

As Kenneth has told you we really enjoyed ourselves in Barcelona. We found the people to be
very friendly and very helpful. Just when we got over the border there was a tourist bureau so we
stopped and I went in and asked for a map of the city. She gave me a map, told me what street we'd
be coming in on and circled the tourist bureaux where we could find hotel information. One
information center seemed to be in a complex with a metro station, a train station, some shops, and
a few hotels around. And whadda ya know? With only a very minor detour we made it right there.
(We're getting good at this finding our way around strange cities in a vehicle.) The metro and train
stations were underground; the information booth, a Dairy Queen and a bunch of shops were on ground level ; and the Hotel Barcelona Sants was above the whole thing. We decided we’d stay in this hotel. It was nice and the price was reasonable, and breakfast was included. Surprise! Surprise! We went to Dairy Queen for supper that night and among other things ordered patatas, zuma de naranja and for dessert had conos and Ian had a cono cum chocolata. We’re getting to be such international eaters!

We had decided, while we were there, that we would go home by a different route. We drove
down to Barcelona along the coastline and since we intended to go to Andorra on the way home, we
decided that we would take the route going across country rather than retrace our steps. Before
leaving we took our maps, went down to the hotel desk, and asked one of the guys there the best way
to get out of the city, and the best route to take to go to Andorra. (We had this conversation in
English, by the way. We found that more Spaniards were conversant in English than in French. And
the few that told me they knew “un petit peu” French meant EXACTLY that. However...) He gave us
very clear instructions, wrote the names of the cities we should be heading to on the map, told us
about highway conditions and generally answered all our questions. Armed with all this we set out
early in the morning in very high spirits. After about a half hour I noticed that, according to the
road signs, the city we were heading for was further south along the coast and not at all in the
direction we wanted to go. We must have missed a turn-off somewhere. Anyway, we turned around
and decided to pull into a service station to see if they had a map with route numbers on it. This
attendant spoke only Spanish. Kenneth asked him if he had a “carte” but he didn't understand so
Kenneth showed him the one we had in the car as an example and he said, “Oh, mapa.” Who knew?

At any rate, we showed him where we wanted to go and he told us it was “complicata”, but he headed
us in that direction anyway. We took the turn-off we thought we were supposed to take and ended
up - I'm not quite sure. It was definitely an industrial area, but whether it was the outskirts of
Barcelona or another little town just outside Barcelona, we never did figure out. However, we did
find another service station, so, ever optimistic, we stopped again. These guys didn't speak English
either but one guy said the other spoke a little French and he'd be back to help us in a minute.

When 15 minutes had passed we started thinking that maybe he wasn't all that keen to talk to us, so we left. Kenneth decided that if we drove in a straight line we'd end up somewhere; so this is what we did. And, lo and behold, we came to signs pointing to the highway we wanted to take, an hour and a half after leaving our hotel, we were straight into the highway we wanted to take. So, an hour ___ There's a tunnel over 5 kilometers long that goes through the city and towards Andorra. This route, What a difference. When we entered it was summer-like, when we came out it was winter. There was snow on the ground and everything. It was quite a shock. Then we realized we were almost two thousand meters above sea level.

There are tons of stores, they found to be a disappointment. It's like one giant shopping mall. Montpellier. Maybe we missed something. We saw where no better than what we could find in ___ So we decided to come home. Here we are, 2000 meters up, going down a mountain with precipitation falling and dark about to arrive in an hour. Every now and then, on the side of the road you'd see somebody fiddling with tire chains. The problem was we didn't know whether they were taking them off or putting them on. Needless to say, the chauffeur was a little nervous. If we'd had the Mazda it would have been a breeze. But we made it; and we saw some magnificent scenery along the way. We also found a terrific ski hill so if anyone has plans to go skiing in Andorra, I know just the place.

The funny thing was, when we crossed into France all the road signs looked familiar and we laughed to think that we felt like we were on home turf. The rest of the vacation passed relatively quietly and we celebrated New Year's Eve (la Réveillon) with a bottle of Real champagne. Actually, we celebrated Christmas Eve with a bottle of champagne, too.

So here we are back to routine. Ian is studying a play of Molière's in French class and his teacher told him that we should go down to Pézenas sometime because there's a barber shop there where Molière got his hair cut, plus a few other things of historical interest. It’s only about 40 minutes away so we'll make that a definite. Anyway, it's time to sign off. Thanks to all of you who remembered us at Christmas. Would you believe we're still getting cards? Must be the Christmas RUSH. Until next time. Take care everyone.

Love,
Anne.
