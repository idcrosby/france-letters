Hello all,

Kenneth got so sick and tired of me saying, “You should put that in your next letter" that he
told me to write my own. So here I am trying to do just that. I can't believe it's already the end of
November. Today wasn't a very nice day - raining and only 10°. The past four or five days have
been sunny and between 14° and 16°. I love to rub that in whenever I get the chance. Have much
snow there?

We're going to open a stall at the marché this Saturday in Gignac. The latest taste sensation
from Canada - Peanut Butter Sandwiches, only 10 francs each. With the amount of peanut butter
we've amassed so far we should make about $200. We've also arranged for Laura to set up a stand
right next to us selling beverages. Who knows where we'll be going for Christmas?

I was thinking the other day about all the things I used to take for granted in Canada. For
example: burners on a stove that have more temperatures than “very high” and “sort of high";
going to a grocery store (or any store for that matter) at 1 o'clock in the afternoon and finding it
open; going to a library and taking home as many novels in English as you want and when you finish
them going back for more; buying a carton of eggs and not finding feathers on them; rolled oats;
being able to buy flour in a 10 kilo bag; baking soda...

On the other hand there are a number of things to which one can become used (like that turn
of phrase?). For example: going to the GROCERY store and finding a whole aisle full of wines, with
the average price running about $4 a bottle (and believe me I've been taking advantage of this!!!);
Sending the kids two steps down the road at 7 o'clock in the morning to buy bread still warm from
the oven (and we're not talking baker's fog here either). (One morning after I had sent Ian because
I was still in my slippers, he came home and said, “That's nothing, Mom. The lady across the street
was there in her bathrobe.” Ah, life is casual in the country, what ?); buying a bottle of
Glenfiddich for $25; mild winters; saying ‘bonjour’ when you walk into a store and ‘au revoir’
when you leave, really good yogurt, cheap grapes...

Bread is an interesting topic. Of course, nobody bakes their own bread here. I'm almost
ashamed to admit we do it at home. You can get anything you want or need at the “boulangerie’ or at
one of the numerous marchés. Coming from germ-infested Canada where everything is sterilised 3
times and wrapped twice, it's a shock to the system to see the baker take one of the unwrapped
loaves, put a little piece of paper around the middle of it, or maybe not, and hand it to you to take
home like that. Of course, that makes it very convenient if you're a little hungry, you can have a
nibble on the way home. Judging from the number of loaves I've seen without ends, this is quite a
common practice.

NEWS FLASH !!! Barren Hill, Cape Breton. In an unusual turn of events a 10 point buck
apparently jumped out in front of Vince MacGregor and dropped dead at his feet. According to one
eye witness the deer's last words were, “Anne really wants to make mince meat when she comes
home, since she found that recipe using venison."

This month's award winners:   
Joe and Francine Churney - for the Most peanut butter.  
Robert Crosby - for the BIGGEST jar of peanut butter.  
Dorita Churney - for the first Christmas card received.  
Nana Crosby - for the only ‘surprise’ package received.  

By the way, if anyone knows of anyone sending a package this way, throw in a plastic
measuring cup and a set of measuring spoons. You wouldn't believe how inaccurate measurements
can be when you use an old jam jar. (Kenneth's all worried now that I'll get about 6 of them.)

I'm really glad to see how much YOUR French has improved since we've moved here.

Well, that's it for me, folks. Take care and remember: EVERY letter is appreciated.

Anne
