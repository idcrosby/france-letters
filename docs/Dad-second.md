The second letter of Ken to the Canadians   
September 26   
Sunday

Bonju Mesurs, Dames

The above salutation is my attempt to [educate you anglais as to the proper greeting given on the street. At least the sound will be correct]. I am very hesitant to start my rambling for this letter. Mom called yesterday and told me she enjoyed the letter, so my fear is that this will not live up to your expectations. But who gives a merde, because if you liked it I should have enough peanut butter to last me.

What have we been up to? It has taken quite a long time and beaucoup de government bureaucracy but last week or so we became mobile. During which Anne only threatened to pack up and leave twice. Since Sunday I haven't heard a word. All you rosby's thought it would be me and you are wrong again. We purchased a 1984, 85, 86 Renault... It started off as an 84 with papers showing an 85 delivery but it sold on the carte grise (vehicle permit) as an 86? These French, by, drive you crazy.

Anyway last Sunday, Sept 19, since it started out gray, we decided to drive to a grotte only five minutes away. What is a grotte?

It turns out that all over the country there are these caves which have stalactites and stalagmites. These are called grottes. The one we visited is called the grotte de Clamouse and after paying the twenty dollars for the guided tour Anne and I had that HAD again feeling. I figured if we could kill a half hour and take some pictures that would be a bonus. The grotte was magnificent or if you're 10 or 13, it was wicked cool. The tour lasted about an hour and we all left very satisfied. Like our theatrical priest and his sermons, I felt bad for the guide and his wonderful explanations since I have learned so well to smile and nod my head.

On the way home from the grotte we discovered what looks to be a popular swimming site. Hopefully more on that later if we get the weather for a swim.

Monday morning and the children are on the way to the college, the weather looks fine so Anne and I decided to take our first day trip. There is a city to the south of us called Sete and it looks like there may be a beach close. Off we go in search of the bureau de tourisme. The city is only 75 km away but with our unscheduled detours (mistakes) it takes us an hour and fifteen minutes to get to the centre-ville. This is a tourist town, with English novels, and a beach that is 10 km long.

After we found the directions to the beach, which took a ten minute walk in circles and a few questions to the locals, it was approaching midi. Around the village square we encountered a chip wagon which had French and American quick food. Being the adventuresome eater that I am I chose a hot dog and some fries. The hot dog came in a one and a half foot baguette. The baguette is like a sub without the inside. It's bread like a big bun, maybe you had to be there. Anyway it cost about two dollars but to my surprise there were two hot dogs end to end. What a treat. A long hot dog, some fries, a beer on a park bench smiling at all the retired Frenchmen who were cursing the Canadians for taking over their bench. Life is nice.

Time to find a bathroom before we search for the beach.  
Time to digress.  
When we were on the train from Marseille to Montpellier Ian remarked that he couldn't believe how many ways there are to flush a toilette.  
On a plane you push a button.  
On the train you step on a pedal.  
There are push and pull levers, pull up buttons, flick a switch or my favorite, pull on the chain. Note: Ian has tried all of these and his number one choice is step on the pedal.  
This WC we found in Sete was great.  
Laura thinks the strangest things amuse me and I told her to read letter number one.  
For all of you sci-fi fans this toilette can only be described as a large pod. I search for the way in. Some words in French I don't understand but there is a picture of a French franc.  
No Graham this is not Frankie Gillis. The light is green so I put in the franc. The door slides open, like on the old Enterprise, and there is a shiny white bowl; no it's two shiny white bowls. One for your hands. The lower one is set so I am glad to be a male. I do my business but I cannot find any way to flush this machine. I've pushed ever lever and searched the entire pod. What will I tell Ian? Never mind Ian, I think Anne wants in here next.  Well I have to leave and before anyone can enter, the pod closes up and after a minute or so the green light comes on. Neat or what. Anne entered a clean pod but I still am glad to be a male. This inventor had to be one of us.


Only one unscheduled detour and we were on the longest beach I've ever seen. The sun was hot, the sand was smooth and the water was refreshing. The color of the water was just like they describe in books - kind of azure. As we swam in the water at one o'clock I chuckled thinking that in ten minutes the first class would begin at Cole Harbour. Sorry Eileen but you have to try one of these leaves. We walked along the beach but there was no way we were going to reach the end.

Mom, you know some of these ladies do not wear tops. I don't look though especially after Anne whacked me up side my head, which was good because it knocked my eyes back in place. But seriously, they change on the beach or if they have to use the bathroom they pull over to the side of any road and go. I guess they don't have a frank or they are bored with their technology.

At three o'clock we decide to head out to make sure we will be home when the children get home at 5:15. After a few major unscheduled detours we arrived home at 4:45. Not bad for a forty-five minute drive. When you get on the super highways they donâ€™t want to let you off. We thought we might have to call the kids from Barcelona which is 240 km from Sete.

On Thursday we decided to check out Montpelier which is only half an hour from here. No major happenings in Montpelier. They have just as many shoe stores as the Mayflower Mall. It has a very pretty centre-ville and a McDonalds. In and out without incident and no new ways to flush.

Well that brings us almost up to date. So I should tell you about today's trip back to Sete with the children.

The day started out sunny, with a northwest wind, but we wanted the kids to see the beach so we decided to go after mass. Mass was to begin at 11 so out the door at 10:45. Something is different this morning since usually the bells ring from 10:45 until 10:55 and it seems very quiet on our walk up. The church is locked but the notice on the door reads mass at 11:00. Maybe there is a secret code and only Anianians understand. Home we trot for an early lunch and a head start to the beach. At 11:45 we are changed and out the door. The bells begin but it really read 11:00 on the notice. As Laura would say "DUH". It wasn't until our trip home that I figured out maybe the clocks were turned back on Saturday. We are now only 4 hours ahead of you for a month anyway.

The trip to the beach now takes us only 45 minutes. The air was cool at first but warmed up in the later afternoon. We were typical Canucks, being the only ones regularly in the water. A good time was had by all.

So now I am really up to date.

Points of interest:

Laura is learning to wind surf with her school group on Wednesday. They go to school Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday 8:30 to 5:00. Wednesday is open for sports which are optional. She finds the work very difficult and works very hard at her homework. Oh and she has to go to school on Saturday morning as well.

Ian is enrolling in Ju-Jitsu this week. He seems to be having an easier time of it and has Saturday off. They both really enjoy their teachers who are going out of their way to help. One of Laura's teachers told her he would mark her easier because she was handicapped. Laura smiled and thanked him and laughed all the way home.

Still no T.V.

We have made reservations for Eurodisney during their October break. Oct 24 till Oct 28 we will be in Paris.

Travel is going to be restricted to the breaks because Laura refuses to take time off school. I still haven't figured out how to reason with that child because she is always right.

I've been running for two weeks and have joined a health club. The French for me is still a mystery and I feel like a deaf mute smiling and nodding my way through conversations. Next week I may try to smile and tell them to shove their language. Signing off for now. Go get 'em Blue Jays.

											Allez Au revoir,
											Ken Crosby and family

P.S. I haven't even waited for a reply from the last letter so this will have to be my October letter. I expect life to get pretty complacent for a while.
