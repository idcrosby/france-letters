Hello peoples

This is part 2 of the letter so if you haven't read the first page do so now.

That Anne has a nasty streak what? But the weather has been so nice it is very hard to believe Christmas will be here in three weeks. Still no plans for the vacation except we will be staying for Christmas. (Laura's orders). If the weather stays warm we will probably scoot down to Spain and visit Andorra on the way home. I can't even think about skiing yet.

One of the instructors over at the gym (no not him he still avoids me) was telling me that January and February are quite cold. That is to say it stays close to zero most of the day. March is supposed to be très beau. None of this conversation is a certainty however as I continue to struggle with le francais. Not only do I have trouble with French but check out this feeble attempt.

To Aniane came a Caper one time
With language number one on his mind
When he asked if they comprenez
Puzzled looks he received many
So now he is a master of mime.

I really do have too much time on my hands.

The inspiration or lack thereof comes from my dear son who told me, "Yes I would like another doughnut" when I asked him if he understood my French - "en français".

The Marché

In part one of this letter Anne mentioned the marché. It is so familiar to us now that I had to go back and review the other letters to make sure you weren't already introduced.

Each community has a specific day when merchants arrive and set up their display for the market. The size of the marché depends on the size of the community. Two which we go to regularly are on Saturday in Gignac or in Clermont on Wednesday. They sell everything from CDs to scissors and from wine to ducks. Real ducks with the quacker still in operation. On Saturday there was a table which was taking names for turkeys but we didn’t want to risk having to take the gobble out of Mr Turkey before we tossed him into the oven.

The best part of the market is the people themselves. The French in the Midi is like the English from the country. The older ladies seem to sing the language rather than talk it. Some expressions we hear a lot and are surprised at are "Oh-la-la!" and "Coo-Coo". The first is self-explanatory and the second is the French form of "You-Hoo".

Speaking of French the octagonal red signs at the end of the roads in France say stop not arret and they have never heard of the fin de semaine. Here it is called "le weekend".

Other points of interest would be Ian receiving his yellow belt in Ju-jitsu. Since he received his belt he must now get a "carte sportif". This is where all his accomplishments are recorded by the government. Don't ever think our bureaucracy is bad until you see this one.

Laura's line for this month concerns Mom's letters so if you haven't read one be sure to pick one up. Noreen would like the way she describes Nana's letters. Laura calls them "the incredible journey". We are thrilled by your letters, Nana, and don't change a thing.

Joyeux Noël et Bonne Année
