The sixth letter of Ken to the Canadians

Hello again  
Well here we go for the second last time. I know I promised an in-depth description of the
vines and the vineyards but lets first talk about politics.

When we left in August you were in the midst of an election and I must confess the
electioneering was not missed although the outcome was eagerly awaited. Maybe the powers that
be can call an election and the vote would be the next day. If you think this is a valuable idea maybe
we can start our own party. Platforms of ideas are easy to build.

Why am I going on about elections?

It seems that although I missed one in Canada I gained one over here. Some of the more
interesting points are firstly the P.C. party. We all remember this party many eons ago in Canada
was the Progressive Conservatives. In France the P. C. party is the Parti Communiste. The fight
over here seems to be between the left and the right. The left consists of a coalition of the
communists, the socialists and le verts or as we know them “the green party”. The right is the
present ruling party of conservatives. One of the must noticeable differences is the absence of
those artistic lawn decorations which grow during election time.

Enough about elections but still on the political stage. How about the French and their
strikes? They could teach us Capers, supposedly known for our strikes, a thing or two.

I don’t know what kind of news reports you get at home but these guys are crazy.

When we first arrived I was aware of the strength of the farmers union. The rest for me
was all education. Air France employees managed to take the world stage by shutting down many
airports late in 93. The ransacking and running battles with police were a definite eye opener.
The train employees seem to take a couple of days each month in rotating strikes. La poste has had
the odd day off and once in a while the news has a strike update listing all the services effected. The
latest crisis is with the fisherman who managed to burn down the parliament buildings in Rennes,
a city on the Atlantic coast. These boys you don't want to tangle with. When it comes to organizing
rallies "manifestations" the French are second to no one.

O. K. onward to more interesting and worldly events. SPORTS

I know you are all on the edge of your seats, as we are, over the outcome of the five
nations cup. ‘Which sport is that?’ I hear some of you non sport enthusiasts ask?

Why le rugby of course.

A run down of the more recent outcomes. Sadly in the first round France beat Ireland in a
hard fought battle. Now I Know why they play every two weeks. Also in the first round Scotland
and Wales beat up each other and England had the bye.

Other news in Sport. The French Cup is down to the final 16 teams in le Foot. The problem
I have here is they only list 14 teams in the news reports so I have yet to find the other two. A
good soccer game is like watching paint dry which is probably why the fans invent games of their
own like "toss the flare into a crowd" or “swarm the lost security guard".

One of the games I have been most recently introduced to is “Ask the Anglais”.

This usually occurs during my runs. The car slows down and the people inside look you
over to see if you look English. If you pass inspection they roll down the window and ask directions
to some destination. The winner is the family who hears the phrase” Je ne parle pas français”
more than any other family. A very popular pastime in this region.

Finally in sports. They are holding bullfights in Nimes next weekend. Ian and I would
like to go and cheer for the bull but tickets are very hard to come by as it is not often they travel
outside Spain.

The first week of February has now passed and although we are still waiting for winter
our neighbors inform us that in the month of February it sometimes gets as cold as it did in
January. Oh Horrors!

So I guess when it reaches +12 °C the weather is cold. A person can get very used to this
climate. This is the closest thing to Shangri-la you could imagine. The temperature usually climbs
to 15 °C but it is the constant sunshine that makes life easy to take. The kids still take their gym
classes outside unless it rains which it did once in January and twice so far in February. Must be
the rainy season. These people must have done something right to deserve this life.

Our neighbors have been keeping Anne informed of the temperatures in Canada and would
like to know if it is possible to go outside. Well if 12 °C is cold to them then you can imagine what
their understanding of -20° would be.

Two pieces of information I have been meaning to get to you concern life in our small
village. Firstly, what to do when you need to tell the people in your village about a sale in your
store, a lost dog or maybe a loto (bingo) in the local bar. Get in touch with the town hall and
voilà, instant message. The message is broadcast over speakers placed around the centreville. To
get your attention however they first play a musical selection like "The Good the Bad and the Ugly”
or some bizarre Basque composition which sets the dogs to howling. The best part for us is the
start of every message begins with "Allo, Allo". Only you true British Comedy lovers will
appreciate this beginning.

The second tidbit concerns the bells. Every hour the bell tolls the hour twice. Yes twice.
So at six o'clock it gongs and then around five after six it gongs another six times. During our first
morning when they first started we were counting to see what time it was. It turned out to be 37
o'clock but on further examination the church also has a bell tower and gongs out the Angelus at
seven, twelve and seven in the evening.

Well that is the end of my rambling. One more to go in March with my thoughts on Italy.

As stated earlier we are aware of your temperatures and remember the February blabs very well so
I leave you with two rules to keep you healthy and happy.

1) Don’t sweat the small stuff.  
2) It is all small stuff.

Allez, Au revoir  
Ken and family
