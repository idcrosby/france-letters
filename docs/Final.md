Buongiorno:

Well, we're back from Italy and we had our ride in a gondola so the trip was a success. Actually on
the way over I was beginning to think we were on the bus ride from hell. We left the house at
quarter to six in the morning to go to Gignac to catch the bus to Montpellier. There were two other
couples there too, whom we thought were from Gignac (Actually during the trip one of the couples
were very nice to us and spoke frequently and since we didn’t know their names we called them Mr.
and Mrs. Gignac) but it turns out they were actually from Aniane. Mr. and Mrs. Gignac are the aunt
and uncle of Ian's History teacher. Small world, huh? They're going on another tour to Canada in
May. Anyway, we picked up the real tour bus in Montpellier and away we went - a bus full of
retired couples, and us four. Laura became very acquainted with elevator music on the bus. She
really wanted to have enough nerve to ask the bus driver to play one of her tapes. But alas, she
figured no one would enjoy it but her. At any rate, our trip took us along the south coast past
Nimes, Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo, then into Italy along the coast to
Genoa and then across to Venice. The scenery, needless to say, was magnificent. Before we came to
the Italian border the bus driver explained that we would be going through the Alps - literally - by
going through over a hundred tunnels. Laura decided to count them and so did the lady behind us so
at various points throughout the trip her husband would lean over the seat to ask what count Laura
had so far. They ended up with 133. This made a good pastime for a while. And the bus driver
showed us a few films of what we were going to see, and the scenery passed, and it got dark. And
finally, at about 8:30 that night we arrived at the hotel. 14 hours on a bus! The trip to Beaver
Cove will be a piece of cake after this. Our meal was awaiting us so we ran up and threw our bags
in the rooms and went down to eat. Now eating, we did well on this trip. There was no such thing as
ordering - you ate what they put in front of you. Breakfast was coffee, orange juice, rolls and
pretend toast; and then there were two main meals - one at noon and one at about 8 p.m. Actually
this is typical of Europeans, except you're supposed to have a snack (or goûter) mid-afternoon.
Laura is so embarrassed that we actually eat supper at 5:15 and if anyone comes to the door she
wants to close the kitchen door so no one will see us. At any rate, the main meals always consisted
of an entrée (sometimes soup, sometimes pasta), a main course and a dessert, and naturally there
was always a bottle of wine on the table. I, of course, thoroughly enjoyed myself. And surprisingly
enough, Kenneth and Ian ate a fair amount as well - pasta and soup included. Mind you, it was
either eat that or starve.

Thursday bright and early it was 'in-to-Venice-day’. We had a half hour ride in a gondola to get
to Place Saint Marco. We nicknamed our gondola driver ‘Speedy’, because although we couldn't
understand what he was saying, by his gestures and the other driver's response we figure he was
complaining that the guys in front were too slow. When we got out to the main canal he had enough room so he passed the slow guys. By the way, do you know how a Venetian crosses the street? Standing up in a gondola, reading the newspaper, of course. Of this we have a picture.

 Friday we went to the islands of Murano and Burano – the lace making and glass making islands. We got to see a demonstration of glass blowing, too. Absolutely amazing – this guy made a little blue glass horse in about four minutes.

Saturday was ‘go-to-Verona’ day and to the “presqu'ile of Sirmione”. We had a guided tour of Verona of course, and we saw Juliette's balcony and Romeo's house (mind you nobody's sure that they actually ever existed). And Sirmione had some really pretty scenery.
Sunday was a bit rushed. We were on the bus at 7:30 and pull out of town. As is always the way with return trips, it didn't seem half as long as the way there. We were back in Aniane by 9p.m. tired but happy. You know for every one of the trips we've taken we haven't had one rainy day. Amazing isn't it?

I've taken over Kenneth's sports column. Ian was given his orange belt in Ju-Juitsu last month. That's the second belt since he started.
The Gallois (Wales) have won the Five Nations Cup. Even though England beat them in the last game, in total points it was the Galls who took it. We knew you were anxiously awaiting that news.

There are only eight teams left in the French ‘le foot’ Cup. We don’t know how they got down to these eight but Montpellier is one of them.

Well, some startling news on the going-home front. There will only be three of us landing in Halifax on May 1. Laura's friend Melanie's parents have offered to keep Laura until the middle of June so that she can come closer to finishing the school year. At first we declined this offer because of the overnight stay in Amsterdam, but it turns out that they have friends in Amsterdam who would be willing to pick Laura up at the airport, keep her overnight, and take her back to the airport to catch her flight the next day. Laura, of course, is thrilled to death and Melanie is excited because now Laura will be here for her birthday.

That's it for me. Take care all. See you in May.

Arrivederci,
Anne
