Bonjour People

(THE VILLAGE)

I guess I should start to describe the town (oops sorry ), I mean le village. When we first arrived on the autocar (bus) we made quite an impression on the folk who happened to be on the esplanade. This area is where the townsfolk, (villagers), sit around and talk about unemployment, world peace and the price of pain (bread). Anyway, picture if you can four very weary travelers disembarking from an autocar with eight very huge suitcases and four overnight bags and into thirty-degree weather wondering which way to turn. An elderly gentleman at the corner of the street looked very confused when we asked him for directions.

"Rue de la tour?" Anne queried.

He looked confused and proceeded to point down the highway.

We later learned he was either telling us to "Get the hell out of town." or he was directing us to the hotel on the outskirts of le village.

Personally, I think he was deaf because we were within a stone's throw from our street.

To our rescue came another older gentleman trying to get his bike out of his house. He was having little luck since there were suitcases in front of his front door. He pointed down the alley and told us, through our interpreter Anne, to take a left at the bakery (la boulangerie).

These allies as we came to learn are streets. Ours we had been told was too narrow to drive down so here I begin to worry. Our street is actually as wide as the rest but it has a very sharp curve which prevents thoroughfare.

If we were in a city I think we would be considered the projects.

We are not in a city and this is what the French call "maison de ville."

In the want-ads we have learned that a villa is a house. One all by itself. A maison, which is a step down, is like a duplex in Canada and our maison de ville is a row house.

On the outskirts of le village are the villas, and the maison and the maisons de ville make up the center of le village. Everywhere you walk in le village is a boulangerie. The bread is always fresh and very tasty. What they say about the pastry is true. And their croissants are unbelievable.

I digress.

The town is made up of very old structures all made of stone and cement, except for the newer villas which are built of a large pinkish brick. It is a very quiet little picturesque village. My major complaint is the dog shit. It seems everyone has a dog and they have to go but the old poop and scoop should be in effect. Laura is always telling me to watch my step. I thought she was going to throw away her new sneakers the other day when she realized she had stepped in it. Anne to the rescue again with the scrub brush and soap.

(THE FOOD)

The rest of the descriptions will be more concise or I may be at this terminal all evening.

As stated earlier the pastry and bread are remarkable. On Sept 4th Anne was presented with a double decker cream-filled caramel covered pastry. It was the closest we could find to a birthday cake.

Our first visit to the local butcher (le boucher) was our last. A quick exit was made when the kids saw the chicken with beak and tootsies, the sign which advertised hen for sale and assorted meats which to us were unrecognizable. We now buy our meat at the intermarche in Gignec. (pronounced jenyac) This town is six kilometers away through the local vineyards. A very pleasant walk but tomorrow we are buying a second hand car and I don't think we will miss the walk.

Here's the extracted text from the third image:

(THE WEATHER )

It has been almost two weeks and the weather has been tres beau. A little nip but by ten it has warmed up to around twenty five. We had a hail storm on Saturday night which educated us to the reason for shutters. The French call it “grele” and they blame it on Ireland. Sort of like the Americans blaming winter on Canadians. The rain did clean the doggy stuff off the streets.

(THE PEOPLE)

Before we reached town I thought we were dealing with a French speaking American state. It seemed to be a chore for anyone to get off their butt and give any assistance. Since reaching Aniane our neighbors have gone out of their way to be of any assistance.

Point of interest -We were told that you cannot smoke in France. This however should have been that you are obligated to smoke in France. Everywhere we go people smoke. Today on our walk back from Gignac we saw a smoke-filled phone booth. Before we notified the authorities the door opened and a gentleman and his dog emerged. Not to worry about cancer though they probable will all die of alcohol related problems. Drinking the vin is considered a patriotic way to save rural France. Everyone seems very patriotic. Most people have drinks around seven and eat at eight. So who cares if the chicken still has its beak.

(POT-POURRI)

Let's finish this letter with some disjointed comments. A technique taught to me by my mom.

The church here is a marvelous old building. The murals inside are spectacular and the craftsmanship is a wonder. I have plenty of time to look because I don't have a clue what the priest is saying. I was a bit concerned during our first mass. It seems that families don’t go to church, only the older ladies and a few elderly gentlemen. I guess they pray enough for the whole village.

The drivers here are Crazy. They all drive like Andrew when he lived in Halifax. He has improved so much since then. The last sentence inserted so mom doesn't give him a hard time.

The children have enrolled in school (le college) and have overcome their nervousness mainly due to the acceptance of the other students. The system, that is the curriculum is more difficult than in Canada and we felt that this will be doubly beneficial to the kids. Even Ian has homework.

To end I guess a brief description of the maison de ville. There are four levels. The first level or cave is mainly for storage. There is a washing machine, a shower and a W/C (water closet) or toilet. The toilet is a cave has a pull chain in which I take great delight in using. Simple things amuse ...... I can never remember how that ends. The second level has an eat-in kitchen and living room. This is where we keep the computer, radio and Sega so the kids are usually in the living room. Off the living room is a small walled-in garden or place to have tea. The third level has the bathroom and the two bedrooms the children use. Ian has bunk beds and Laura has a double bed. The loft contains a double bed and a terrace. The terrace is a wonderful place to look at the stars or get some sun. Lots of room for visitors. No double booking please.

Well there you have my first letter. There may even be more now that we are mobile. Spain is high on our agenda. If you would like to be considered for the next letter all you have to do is send PEANUT BUTTER.

Love to all
Ken Crosby and family
