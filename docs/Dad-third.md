The third letter of Ken to the Canadians
October 20, 1993

Ello Ello

BOOM... BOOM!!!
It is truly amazing how sounds remind you of home.
The sound is that of a shotgun. The setting is in the vineyards between Gignac and Aniane.

I thought in this letter, since our lives seem to have melded into that of the français, to bring you along on a typical day.
Rising at around seven o'clock. Vacation still has not cured my appointment with dawn.
Outside by seven ten. The weather has been very consistent and shorts and a tee shirt is all that has been needed so far. The temperature is usually between 12 and 16° in the morning.

I can remember the first days of fall at St. F. X. when the students from Coady would walk around in winter coats and ear muffs. The looks they received are now being returned to the scantily clad canuck running down the road.

The first part of the run is the worst, running through the narrow streets dodging the stuff and paying close attention to the cars which are much too close for comfort. At about a half a mile out is an old railroad bed converted into a road which is where the letter actually began. Hearing the sound reminds me of hunting season which is about to start in Nova Scotia. If these hunters are as good a shot as Vince and Joe then I should be safe and so should Bambi's dad back home.

In case a deer does jump out and say "Shoot Me" save me some deer burger.
Running on this path is a real treat. There are vineyards on both sides and it is flat and straight. The mountains in the distance sparkle as the sun comes up and burns off the morning dew. Here there are no cars whizzing by and a great way to start the day. I've worked my way up to 5 miles with very little knee or ankle pain. The hunters are only allowed in the vineyards to hunt on Wednesday and Saturday now that the grapes have been harvested. There is no school on Wednesday, and Saturday is a half day so there is always that chance to bag a student in the fields.

The rest of the morning I spend in a town called Clermont l'Herault. Here I discovered a hole in the wall gym where I struggle to communicate and to get in shape. The communication doesn't go so well as Laura has informed me that I think I told one of the instructors "I love you and the towns are very pretty". He pretty well stays clear of me now.

I get back home at around 11:30, have a lunch, watch some T.V. and try and learn some French. This is a typical day for the Canuck en France. You will all be relieved that I am as boring here as I am in Canada.

November 12, 1994

It has been a while and I almost forgot about you.

The trip to Eurodisney was, to quote Ian "wicked awesome." However it was cooler than we expected.

We took the train from Montpellier to Paris, passing through Avignon and Lyon. This is one train which moves. We calculated it must have averaged 170 mph from Lyon to Paris. From Paris we took the Métro (subway) for a half hour and landed on Disney's doorstep. For three days I was able to survive in English, striking up conversations with any Brit I found and embarrassing the kids. We had an excellent time in the park and went on all the rides. At this time of year there was just enough time.

On the fourth day we went into Paris. Toured the Arc de Triomphe, shopped along the Champs-Elysées, walked along the Seine and shot up to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The views from the top were nothing short of spectacular. I thought the first and second stage of the tower were high but when we got out on the top it was like walking into Yankee Stadium for the first time.

Before we made our way back to the train station we had to find a restaurant. With all the wonderful chic establishments in the area we finally chose Burger King.

News Items

We have a TV. Actually, we purchased it just after the last letter and enjoy such classics as Papa Schultz, Familie en Or, Le Juste Prix, Le Saint and Papa Bricole or you might know them as Hogan's Heroes, Family Feud, The Price is Right, The ______, and Home Improvement. The majority of the shows are American but the commercials are definitely French. Kind of like the beach.

Running has come to a halt. Threw my back out two weeks ago and had to take it easy. Feeling much better now and plan on starting again on Monday. Hope the hunters are finished.

Anne has gone to her first parent-teacher meetings and we feel much better after all the glowing reports. One of Laura's teachers is so impressed with Laura's study habits and attitude she was telling Anne how nice it must be to teach in Canada. Why tell her the truth.

Anne and Laura have been told they have Quebec accents but Ian is our true Frenchman. I on the other hand am learning slowly and am understanding more and more.

Paul Hines won the prize for the first jar of peanut butter. It only took four weeks. I know there is more on the way and I feel bad about the price of postage you had to pay but it tastes MARVELLOUS.

Laura has been awarded the line of the month. In a recent conversation Anne was commenting on the fact that we have not visited any old historic sites. Laura's line "We live in one so why visit someone else's".

Specials at the supermarché this week include steak (cheval), sheep brains, pig snout and sheep hooves. Now you know why we choose Burger King. Bonne appétit.

Allez, Ciou(pronounced chow)
Ken Crosby and family

Anne wants everyday in anticipation of your letters. She really doesn't know you.
Vince
- Hope the hunting is going well
- Still haven't found J.C.
